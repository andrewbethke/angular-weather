# AngularWeather

A simple weather app made using [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).

I originally started working on this several months ago, then forgot about it. When I came back to it, I realized that what I had made no sense, and started over from scratch. The code now makes much more sense, and, this is important, actually works.
